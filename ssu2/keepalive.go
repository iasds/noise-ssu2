// The keepalive mechanism serves multiple purposes:
//  1. Prevents NAT/firewall timeout by keeping UDP mapping active
//  2. Detects dead connections through lack of peer response
//  3. Maintains minimal overhead by piggybacking on data packets when possible
//
// Per SSU2.md specification, the default keepalive interval is 15 seconds.
// Dead connection detection occurs after 3x the keepalive interval with no response.
